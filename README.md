**DermGuard: Erythemato-Squamous Disease Classification**
This project focuses on the classification of erythemato-squamous diseases using a dermatology dataset. The primary objective was to build machine learning models to accurately classify different types of erythemato-squamous diseases based on clinical and histopathological features.

**Key Highlights:**
- Descriptive Analysis: Performed a detailed descriptive analysis of the dataset to explore the distribution of clinical and histopathological features. Visualizations were created to examine the relationships between features and their impact on disease classification.

- Data Preprocessing: Conducted thorough preprocessing, including handling missing values, scaling features using Python libraries in Google Colab.

- Model Development: Implemented various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost. Performance of the models was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- Model Selection: After rigorous testing and validation in Google Colab, the best-performing model was selected based on the evaluation metrics and cross-validation results.

- Web Application - DermGuard: Developed a user-friendly web application using Flask, HTML, and CSS. The application, named DermGuard, allows users to input clinical and histopathological data to predict the likelihood of different erythemato-squamous diseases.

**Technologies Used:**
Python 
Google Colab 
Flask (Backend Web Framework)
HTML/CSS (Frontend Design)
